Order of the Pixel
==================

### General

Order of the Pixel is a small Sinatra API running on Puma using DataMapper &amp; Minitest and it's open for people to
play with it.

### API Description

We enjoy role playing games here at Pixel Perfect Tree so weâ€™ve developed a small API to list the heroes from the Order of Pixel.
A Hero is composed of 3 basic entities, a Weapon, A Race and a Job.

* The **Weapon** is what the hero will wear on his quests (ie: Bastard Sword or Mighty Bow).
* The **Race** is a classification used to categorize heroes into distinct populations or groups by anatomical, 
cultural and geographical (ie: Elf, Dwarf or Orc).
* The **Job** aggregates several abilities and aptitudes depending what role the hero has chosen to follow 
(ie: Warrior, Warlock, Priest or Archer)

Below is an example request that will create a **Weapon**.

}
</pre></code>

}
</pre></code>


Here is an example request that will create a **Job**.
<pre><code>{
    "name": "Paladin"
}
</pre></code>


Here is an example request that will create a **Hero**.
<pre><code>{
    "name": "Thor",
    "weapon_id": 1,
    "job_id": 1,
    "race_id": 1
}
</pre></code>

#### Notes

* At the moment, you can't delete a Weapon, Race or Job if it's currently assigned to a hero 
(But you can delete a hero without destroying it's attached entities).

* Tests can be run using the Rake task `rake test`.

* To run the Sinatra app simply install the dependencies via bundler and run the server from the root using `ruby app.rb`. 

Destroy, update and show actions are available by specifiying the entity's ID at the end (ie: http://order-of-the-pixel.herokuapp.com/api/v1/weapons/1).
